                Arithimagicians is a game made as part of the senior project in our Software Engineering and Capstone
                class. It is an educational game for Android with a target audience of 2nd & 3rd graders.
                Players must progress through fifteen levels on their way to the Arithimagic University of Learnings,
                Skills, and Smarts (with Wisdom taught where applicable) [P.S. It's applicable everywhere, The Dean],
                facing Gobloid and Skeletonian opponents and using a set of magic dice to cast spells. Each opponent
                displays two mathematical formulas which must be overcome. Arithmetic operations can include addition,
                subtraction, multiplication, and division.

                The dice are placed in blank fields and rolled in unison with the intent to get a value higher than
                the given answer. Players earn experience points from each battle to spend on more dice, larger dice
                values, or bonuses to die rolls. Each die has 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20 sides.

                The game can also be linked to an online account, which progress and review important stats about their
                game-play. An online account also allows the account owner to purchase power-ups which can aid the
                player in the game. Power-ups include bonuses to damage,gaining experience points, finding treasure,
                and regaining hit points.
